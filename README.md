 Description
 ---
 I found that there is no mod in 1.7.10 doing a good job at breaking the 64 item stack size limit, so I make one with mixin.

 Need UniMixin as a dependency to work.

 Mod Compactibility
 ---
 The mod is still in beta-stage, I am trying to add more compact to popular mods as fast as I can.

 If you know a mod that have a compactibility issue with this mod you can tell me directly.

 You can see what mods does it compact at a specific version in the changelog and release description.

 WARNING
 -
 If you put an item stack larger than 64 into any mod container that's not from the mod on the compact list
 
 There may be unexpected bugs!
