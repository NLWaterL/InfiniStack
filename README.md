What is this mod for:
---
Some GTNH fork of mods use the same modid as the original mod, but have some different classes that I need to mixin.

This is NOT for the whole GTNH mod pack.

If a mod is not supported in the main version, then this mod will not help even it has a GTNH fork.

If you don't use any GTNH mods, you don't need to use it 

If you see the warning message when you load your world, then you should use it with the main mod.

Currently Patched Mod:
---
Adventure Backpack's Fork.
